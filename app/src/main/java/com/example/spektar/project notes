// NOTE TO SELF: YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE VIEWMODELS IN ONE SCREEN, ONLY ONE CAN MODIFY THE UI THOUGH!!!
// actually scratch that, one view model per screen is cleaner but if you need any data to be transferred between two viewmodels
// you should share that through some repository

// DONT DO ANYTHING WITH ERRORS UNTIL YOU FINISH THE APP!!!

/* TODO:
    ### FRONT END
        - home screen
            - this home screen would contain pieces of media you're currently consuming, and they'd
            have a progress counter (page X/Y for books and an optional daily goal for books, whereas
            for shows, each season gets it's own "slot" in the repositories, so it'll just be of format
            "Episode X/Y", where X means the last page/episode you watched, Y is max)

        - screen for each media's note
            - peep the bottom of this comment for elaborations (the implement per-media part)

        - profile screen
            - might be redundant if you can integrate into settings screen
        - questionnaire screen

        - settings screen
            - photosensitive mode, profile settings, app language, dynamic color on/off and other
            important stuff you think of

        - splash screen
            - app logo somehow slowly gaining color

        - grid screen for "More..." at the end of the image rows

        - make a color palette cause material3 highk sucks?

        - navigate to profile screen on profileSettings and the actual profile icon itself on the top bar
        - add animations between screens

    TODO: ### BACK-END (sort out after designing screen UIs else you'll just get mad and burn out)
        - after splash screen designing, have the app auto log-on if you have made an account

         - questionnaire (to fill out user's embedding), maybe some data-tracking for user embedding improvement

        - sort out error handling
            - handle any potential errors from supabase and shit
            - ERRORS SHOULD BE HANDLED IN VIEWMODELS!!!

        - implement per-media notes properly
            - Each media should have a LIST of notes belonging to it
            - each note should have a custom user-assigned title, and content that is modifiable
            the content should have modifiable text size, text color, bold/underline/italic,
            hyperlinks that lead to other notes and URLs and stuff y'know

 launchSingleTop = true basically says that you can't mash navigation buttons and have app navigation break
